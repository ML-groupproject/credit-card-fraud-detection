# credit-card-fraud-detection
Detection of credit card frauds using different Machine Learning techniques.

# Dataset
Contains the link to the “Credit Card Fraud Detection” dataset that is publicly available on Kaggle.


# Data Visualization


# Models
1. CatBoost

   Contains code for fraud detection that builds decision trees consecutively and minimizes loss with each new decision tree that is built.

2. Isolation forest

   Contains code for fraud detection which is an unsupervised learning method.

3. LogisticRegression

4. KNClassifier

5. GaussianNB

6. Random forest

   Contains code used to train the fraud classifier by training dataset, building multiple decision trees, and then having the output of the decision trees determine a prediction.

7. XGBoost Method
