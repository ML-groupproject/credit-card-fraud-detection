# credit-card-fraud-detection
Detection of credit card frauds using 5 different Machine Learning techniques.

# Dataset
Contains the link to the “Credit Card Fraud Detection” dataset that is publicly available on Kaggle.

# Models
1. CatBoost.ipynb

   Contains code for fraud detection that builds decision trees consecutively and minimizes loss with each new decision tree that is built.

2. Isolation_forest.ipynb

   Contains code for fraud detection which is an unsupervised learning method.

3. LogisticRegression, KNClassifier, GaussianNB.ipynb

4. Random_forest.ipynb

   Contains code used to train the fraud classifier by training dataset, building multiple decision trees, and then having the output of the decision trees determine a prediction.

5. XGBoost Method.ipynb
